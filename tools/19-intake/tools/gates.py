"""The two gates intake runs — both through `quality_checks.hold`
(components/quality-checks), so `check.json` is keyed by gate like every chain.

    inputs     before anything is read into an index
               both pools are where they live and hold something; the brand is
               a real folder under brands/                         ALWAYS HOLDS
    elements   after every swipe is normalised
               no swipe carries a format (or an organic structure) that is not
               a real row in the element library (components/elements)
               mode hold | warn — DEFAULT warn

WHY THE ELEMENTS GATE DEFAULTS TO WARN: today's pools carry labels the library
has never seen (organic structure reads that were merged away, a judged paid
format). On `hold` the index could not be built at all until those are fixed
at their source or signed into the library — both Damon's call. On `warn` the
index still files, every such swipe is marked `unknown-format` /
`unknown-structure` with the real ids beside it, and `check.json` still says
HELD for the elements gate. Nothing is passed silently, nothing is invented.
