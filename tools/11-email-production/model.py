"""The email system's shape, as data. Read by build_system.py.

Scope, set by Damon 2026-08-27: **campaigns only**, and only three things —
brand context in, a dynamic calendar, an email out. Delivery, feedback and
flows are real and are parked on their own page, not dropped.

Two corrections from the same call, both kept here so they are not undone:
- Sender identity is not brand-root. It belongs to the email — a founder
  email is rich text with a name card, which is a FORMAT decision, and the
  sender follows from the format.
- Language upkeep is out of scope entirely. What matters is that the system
  can read the language that is there.
