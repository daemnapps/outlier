"""One swiped email (or any lane's teardown record) in; one built email out.
Ten stages, all Claude, all text — then `render.py` draws it.

    python3 email.py <source> --brand <brand> \
        --product brands/<brand>/products/body-scrub.md \
        [--subjects 5] [--label sale-01] [--brand-root <tree>]

Mirrors copy/copy.py stage for stage, deliberately: the two lanes are one
machine and a fix in either is worth porting to the other. Read
STAGE-DELTAS.md for what email changes and what it leaves alone.

Runs under the operator's own `claude` login. No API key, no board watcher —
this is a standalone run today; if it becomes a daily habit the way video
teardown did, it earns that infrastructure then, not before.
