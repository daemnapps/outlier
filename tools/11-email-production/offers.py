RULED 2026-09-10 (Damon: "so there's an offer bank issue then…"). The bank is a
prose document with mixed section types — live offers, drafts, expired ones,
guarantees, standing rules, open gaps. Nothing could answer the one question
that matters, *what may this brand offer this reader today*, so:

- the planner invented plausible keys that do not exist (`named-sets`,
  `vitals-sub`) and the chain only found out at run time, twenty minutes in;
- a guard written against the document's headings accepted `rules` and `open`
  as offers;
- a **draft** offer with no price and an **expired** one stayed assignable;
- a dated offer had no end date, so a Labor Day price stayed "live" into late
  September.

The prose stays the human's source of truth. This reads its own structure —
the `## Live` / `## Draft` / `## Expired` headings the bank already keeps — and
turns it into rows. Nothing here knows a brand, a product or a price.

An offer is USABLE on a date when it is: under Live, not a draft, has no
window or has one containing that date, and its lane matches the avatar.
