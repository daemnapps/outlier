"""PICK THE FRAME — the brief chooses it, not taste (Damon, 2026-09-09:
"it's about what the actual image calls for based on the brief that we have.
From that point forward, we need to select the best frame possible to carry
out the idea that we have").

    python3 pick_frame.py --brand <brand> --month 2026-09
    python3 pick_frame.py --direction "close on his neck and jaw"

Every picture slot in a month's briefs carries a direction. This reads the
creator library's own records — `components/video-teardown/records/creators/
<creator>/delivered/index.jsonl`, one row per clip with its recorded setting,
action and shot — and scores each clip against that direction. It never
invents a scene: it names the clip that already shows it, or says the library
has nothing for it, which is an honest gap for a human to fill.

Scoring, in order of weight:
  framing   the direction's own words for distance (extreme close-up, close,
            medium, insert on hands) against the clip's recorded shot
  action    what is happening — the device at the face, cleanser, a towel,
            the tap running, the charging case, talking to camera
  setting   where — the sink, the doorway, a plain wall, the mirror
  props     a named product in the direction against the clip's own
Then the frames of the winning clip are listed so the one that carries the
idea can be chosen by eye, at one frame per second with its timecode.
