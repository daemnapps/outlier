RULED 2026-09-10 (Damon): "you could also look deeper into this event, see what
games are going on for the week too, and bait the audience to engage with it on
top of whatever offer or concept the mail is running… this type of processing
needs to run for EVERY email, not just this sports thing."

A moment is not a label. It is a week, with specific things happening in it,
and the reader is already inside that week. An email that says "football season
is back" is barely better than one that ignores it; an email that names what is
happening the day after it lands is the one that gets answered.

So every send gets a **live read** — the checkable facts of its week, the one
odd thing in it, and two or three ways to invite the reader to engage with the
moment itself on top of whatever the email is selling.

This file writes the RESEARCH BRIEF: the questions to go and answer for each
send, built from that send's own moment, date, market and audience. The answers
come back as `research/<slot>.md` and the chain reads them at stage 1c.

Brand-agnostic and market-agnostic by construction: nothing here knows about a
sport, a country, a brand or a product. The questions are shaped by the KIND of
moment a slot carries, and the brand's own files supply the rest.
