Damon, 2026-09-14: *"we need to have a clear workflow that is extracting from
this calendar so it knows the content of what we're doing, and then goes through
the copy machine to then write those emails."*

The extraction already happens — `brief.chain_argv` turns a slot into a chain
run. What was missing is being able to SEE it. A month's copy costs real money
and an hour, and the failures that matter are all visible beforehand: a slot
with no format to write from, a type that declares it needs an offer and has
none, a variant with no angle. Every one of those produces an email that is
wrong rather than an email that is missing, which is the expensive kind.

So this resolves every send the way the copy machine will, and says what each
one would be handed — without calling a model. Nothing here writes.
