# email-production — brand context in, campaign emails out

> **Current as of 2026-09-20: read `CLAUDE.md` first** — it has what this tool
> takes and makes, how to run it, the free dry run and the checks that hold an
> email back from Klaviyo. What follows below is the 2026-08-27 starting note,

> needs `--brand <brand>` — there is no default brand. Tests:
> `python3 test_rollout.py` (free — no model, no network).

The fourth lane of the content machine, beside `copy`, `image-teardown` and
`swipe`. **Campaigns only** — delivery, feedback and flows are parked in
`PARKED.md`, not dropped.

Three steps: **read the brand → build a dynamic calendar from it → produce the
email.**

## Where things are

| | |
|---|---|
| Brand context | `../brands/<brand>/` — read-only, never written to |
| Email swipes | `../brands/<brand>/existing-content/emails/` — **empty** |
| Variable map | `brand-maps/<brand>.md` |
| The chain | `prompts/` — one file per stage, highest `-vN-` wins |
| The runner | `email.py` |
| The picture | `render.py` |
| Pulled facts | `calendar/` — `derive.py`, `ledger.py`, `brands/` |
| Types | `email-types.json` — 38 types across 5 categories |
| Rules | `DOCTRINE.md` |

## Running it

Check the wiring first — free, no model calls:

```
python3 email.py <source> --brand <brand> --avatar fed-up-king --dry-run
```

Then the chain:

```
python3 email.py <source> --brand <brand> --avatar fed-up-king \
  [--product <path>] [--subjects 5] [--label <name>]
python3 render.py results/<label>
```

**A run declares an avatar.** `fed-up-king`, `glow-up` or `gift-buyer` — three
different audiences, not one with variations. Every language bank, profile and
sub-avatar resolves through it.

## State, 2026-08-27

Wiring verified by dry run: 8 of 10 variables resolve, and the language layer
returns real rows (~8,100 characters of customer sentences for subject lines)
where it previously returned "this brand has no language bank".

Still missing, all called out by the runner at start-up: `sender-identity.md`,
a `products/` folder, and any cultural-moments source. **And there is no email
to swipe** — `existing-content/emails/` is an empty folder, so the chain has
never been run end to end.

## Things a session here must not do

- **Never write into the brand tree.** Read-only, always.
- **Never let the machine pick a subject line**, rank them, or mark one
  recommended. All of them ship.
- **Never improve VERSION 0.** It is the control.
- **Never invent a block type.** The vocabulary is in `render.py`.
- **Never reuse a stage number without retiring the old prompt** to
  `prompts/superseded/`.
- **Never pad a category.** A thin one is a finding to call out.
