    python3 sectionise_brief.py --brand <brand> --month 2026-09 --report SECTIONS.md

The copy side of the machine writes BLOCKS — a headline, a paragraph, a button,
a picture. The design side buys SECTIONS — a hero, a routine, a pricing strip.
Two vocabularies for one email means every handoff is a translation done by
hand, and done differently every time.

This does the translation once, in writing. It walks each run's `design.json`
in order, groups consecutive blocks into sections, and gives each section ONE
name out of a FIXED sixteen. The name is chosen by what the section ARGUES, not
by what block types it holds: a headline over a paragraph over a button is a
hero; the same three blocks carrying a price are pricing.

The sixteen are not extensible here. When nothing fits, the closest name is
used and the section is recorded as low-confidence so a person can look — a
seventeenth name invented in a script is a vocabulary nobody else has.

Writes `sections.json` into each run folder. Reads `design.json`; never writes
it, and never touches anything under results/calendar-* or results/research-*.

Brand-agnostic: the brand is a flag. It resolves which calendar and which run
folders to read, and supplies the one token used to spot the brand's own
furniture (a wordmark line, a nav strip). No brand fact is written down here.
