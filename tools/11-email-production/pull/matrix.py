"""The audience matrix — every planning cell, as one record. (EM-1)

    python3 pull/matrix.py --brand <brand>

Joins what already exists and never invents: the platform segments (from the
brand's segment audit), the avatar roster with its sub-avatars, and the
language depth behind each, into brands/<brand>/email/audience-matrix.json.

The honest limit, recorded in the file rather than papered over: platform
segments do not carry avatar membership, so the SIZE of an intersection cell
(e.g. Returning × fed-up-king) is unknown today. The axes are real; the
crossings are planning cells, not measured populations.

Like every pull, this writes INTO the brand — a deliberate refresh job, not
something a run does on its way past.
