"""Index a brand's type catalogue with the detail a calendar needs to be
built deterministically. (Damon, 2026-08-31: "index the catalogue with
detail — to deterministically create the calendar with detail.")

    python3 pull/index_catalogue.py --brand <brand> [--dry-run]

The catalogue already says what each type IS. This adds what each type
NEEDS AROUND IT, so code — not a model — can assemble a promotional arc:

  carries_offer   does this type require an offer to exist at all
  warm_up         types that can legitimately precede it (earns/sets-up)
  cool_down       types that can legitimately follow it (recovers/closes)
  arc_required    True when this type must never ship alone

Every value is DERIVED from what the catalogue already declares — the
type's own `then`, its `needs`, its role and its well. Nothing is invented,
and a brand that has edited its catalogue gets an index of its own edits.
Re-runnable: it overwrites the `arc` block and touches nothing else.
