    python3 calendar/products.py --brand <brand> [--refresh]

A PRODUCT and an OFFER are different things (Damon, 2026-08-27). The product is
what the thing IS — mechanism, ingredients, features, benefits, specs. The
offer is the commercial construction around it. This writes the product half.

Source is the storefront's own product feed, which is the only place the real
ingredient lists and specifications exist. Everything written is from that
feed; nothing is inferred. What the feed does not say is left OPEN, because a
plausible ingredient claim is the most expensive thing this system can produce.

    --refresh   re-pull the feed. Otherwise the cached copy is used, so a
                rebuild is reproducible and does not depend on the site.
