"""The Email Chain page — every station from the calendar to a Klaviyo draft,
every writing step with what it is handed, what it makes, which model runs it
and its prompt verbatim.

    python3 chain_page.py            # -> email-chain.html + EMAIL-CHAIN.md

Damon, 2026-09-19: "let's be very, very clear on the full email chain and
where we're at… what are the exact steps that we take? What prompts are we
using? What chain reactions are being created… We need to start tweaking each
of those knobs from there."

The step list, the models and the inputs are READ from email.py, and the
prompts from prompts/ — so the page cannot describe a chain the code does not
run. The plain-English lines and the knobs are written here, by hand, and are
the part to keep current.
