"""Read a month's finished copy and say what is wrong with it.

    python3 check_month.py --brand <brand> --month 2026-09
    python3 check_month.py --brand <brand> --month 2026-09 --only moment

Zero cost, no model calls. Every finding names the run, the check and the line,
so it can be fixed or ruled on. This exists because two whole classes of fault
shipped to the board unnoticed:

**THE MOMENT** (RULED 2026-09-10, Damon: "this literally has nothing to do with
football"). A send scheduled on a dated moment came out with no trace of that
moment in it — the occasion reached the filing layer and never reached a stage
that writes. A reader must be able to name the moment from the copy alone, so
that is what this checks.

**THE SEND DAY.** Copy borrowed the swiped email's weekday, so a September send
opened "It's Monday" on a Saturday.

The rest are mechanics — the things a person would catch reading it aloud, and
therefore the things nobody catches reading thirty of them.

Brand-agnostic: every brand fact comes from the brand's own moments file and
its slots, never from this file.
