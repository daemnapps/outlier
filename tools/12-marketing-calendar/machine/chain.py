Before this existed the sequence lived only in the order of statements inside
`calendar.py`, and every other thing that needed to describe it — the docs,
the board, the record on the platform — described it again by hand. Three
hand-written copies of one sequence is three things that drift. This is the
one copy; everything else reads it.

A layer is a stage in a chain in the ordinary sense: it takes what the layers
before it settled, adds exactly one kind of decision, writes that decision
down in its own numbered folder, and hands on. Seven are plain code and cost
nothing to re-run. Two think, and those two are the ones whose prompt and
output have to stay nameable forever — Damon's standing rule is that the
prompt is the product, so a month whose prompt version cannot be named is not
a month anyone can reason about.

# THE COMMERCIAL FLOOR — Damon, 2026-09-14: "every single month for every
# single brand, we should have 20% ask, 80% the rest. Really, every week should
# have an offer. I don't see a reason to not have offers every single week."
#
# A company rule, not a brand one, so it lives in the tool and no brand
# overrides it. It exists because the concepts prompt had only a BRAKE —
# "keep the month from being all asks" — and nothing at all telling it to
# sell, so both brands landed on three asks in a month and nothing noticed.
#
# The two numbers do not fight each other, and it is worth saying why: the
# 20% counts the ASK itself. Its warm-up and its cool-down are `earns` and
# `recovers`, so an arc puts one send in the 20% and two in the 80%.
