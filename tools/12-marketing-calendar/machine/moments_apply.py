Damon, 2026-09-13: *"That is not a decision for me."* He is right, and the
distinction is worth stating because it governs what this file may touch:

  **Research is a judgement and needs him. The record is arithmetic and does
  not.** A moment the brand has already sent into, more than once, whose
  receipts are its own emails and whose performance is its own number, is not
  an opinion anybody has to sign. Leaving it in a report for a person to retype
  is how `cyber-monday` — the brand's best-earning moment at 7x its median —
  stayed unknown to the calendar.

So this writes. What it may write is fenced:

  **A public holiday is `all` by definition** (the brand's own README: `all` =
  a holiday every avatar knows), so a holiday the record proves is filed under
  every avatar, graded `proven`, carrying the emails that prove it.

  **A recurring brand theme is NOT filed.** The record cannot say which avatar
  a send was for, and a theme that really belongs to one avatar, filed as
  `all`, puts it in front of people it was never about. Those are listed for
  him with everything needed to place them — one field, one decision.

It also CORRECTS. An entry already in the file whose grade the record
contradicts is upgraded and its stale note retired: `black-friday` sat as
`territory` with a note reading "not yet run under its own name" while the
record held nine Black Friday sends earning 1.7x the median. A claim written
once and never re-checked is the thing this file exists to stop.

Every write leaves the previous file beside it, and every entry it writes
carries `mined` provenance so its origin is never in doubt.
