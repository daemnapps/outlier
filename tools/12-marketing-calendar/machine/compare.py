Damon, 2026-09-14: *"Some of the way that the blocks are set up looks
inconsistent between both brands as well. I need you to run a check."*

Everything the chain reads from a brand has a shape, and the shape is supposed
to be the same everywhere — that is what brand-agnostic means in practice. When
two brands drift apart, the chain does not fail; it quietly does something
different for one of them, and the month looks fine. Both brands lost their
whole offer bank for a day that way, because one file was reshaped and the
reader was not.

So this compares the SHAPES, not the contents. A brand having different offers
than another is the point. A brand keeping its offers under a different key is
a bug waiting for someone to notice.
