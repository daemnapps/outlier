"""Mine a brand's own record for the moments it has ALREADY been speaking into.

Damon, 2026-09-13: *"How do we even go through the research of identifying what
a brand moment is?"* Until now the honest answer was: a person read the sends
once and typed a file. Nothing re-ran, so a moment the brand started using last
month stayed invisible.

This is the half of that question the brand can answer about ITSELF, and it is
arithmetic rather than judgement, so it costs nothing and can run every week:

  **A moment is proven when the brand has sent into it more than once, around
  the same point in the year, and the record says what those sends earned.**

Two ways a send gets attached to a moment, and both leave a receipt:

  `holiday`   it landed inside a public holiday's window and its words name
              that holiday. The holiday table is layer 1's — real dates, per
              year, so a send is matched against the date that holiday
              actually fell on, never a remembered one.
  `recurring` its distinctive words came back at the same time of year in a
              different year. Two Februaries in a row talking about the same
              thing is a moment; one February is an email.

What this does NOT do, deliberately: it never names a moment the brand has not
already used. Everything it finds is `proven` by construction. Finding what the
avatar's world does that the brand has NEVER touched is the other half — that
is research, it needs the open web, and it belongs to the Control Room's
research recipes. This half just stops that half from re-discovering what the
brand already knows.

Nothing is written into the brand. The output is a proposal a person reads.
