"""The brand's record, as the calendar reads it — and the month's checker.

These are the readers the calendar flow runs on: who the brand's segments are,
which avatars carry no offer, the type catalogue and offer bank as the model
sees them, what the brand has learned, how each segment responds, how cold each
one has gone. Plus `check()`, which tests a finished month against the rules
deterministically rather than trusting the model to have obeyed them.

Moved here 2026-09-13 when the calendar became its own component. They were
inside the email chain's `compose.py`, which meant the calendar could not run
without the email machine — untrue then and wrong now, since a month of ad
concepts reads exactly the same record. Bodies are unchanged; the email
chain imports them back from here, so there is still one copy.
