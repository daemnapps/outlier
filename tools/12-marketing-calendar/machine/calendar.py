"""The calendar flow: a brand's record in, a month's slots out — built from
the ground up, in layers, each layer dated before the next is laid on it
(Damon, 2026-09-02: "ground up the calendar fundamentally").

    python3 calendar.py 2026-11 --brand <brand>
    python3 calendar.py 2026-11 --brand <brand> --dry-run         # free: spends and writes nothing (dryrun.py)

    python3 calendar.py 2026-11 --brand <brand> --continue        # resume from a hand-edited cells.json

Runs start to finish on the record — no checkpoint, no sign-off (Damon,
2026-08-31). One numbered folder per layer under results/calendar-<month>/:

  1-holidays/    code  the public holidays that land in this month, with
                       their real dates (from the tool's holidays table —
                       calendar facts, the same for every brand)
  2-cultural/    code  the brand's own moments that land in this month,
                       each resolved to real dates from its anchor
  3-cells/       AI    who is live this month, who rests — no counts, no
                       ceiling, no floor; every why cites
  4-anchors/     code  every dated holiday and moment laid onto the month
                       at its real date, as ONE send to every live segment
                       it fits — a retail holiday as a full arc (a build-up
                       of 1-4 sends scaled by what the holiday earned
                       before, the ask, the close), an observance as one
                       send on the day; a member falling outside the month
                       belongs to the month it falls in
  5-concepts/    AI    the rest of the month, in order: an offer for every
                       anchored ask, then the concepts the month makes
                       timely, then the educational and other categories
  6-catalogue/   code  every send typed against the catalogue; any offer-
                       carrying ask completed into its arc
  7-offers/      code  every offer checked against the brand's offer bank —
                       an offer no variant can carry is stripped, and an
                       arc with no offer collapses to its holiday send
  8-affiliate/   code  one affiliate partner a week, every week, if the
                       brand has any on file (investor commitment, 2026-09-01)
  9-order/       code  dates resolved around the anchors, hours, sources,
                       links — no send budget exists; the only thing ever
                       refused is an exact duplicate

Then the board: checks.md (every rule, the per-person math) and briefs/
(one page per slot) beside slots.json and run.json at the month's root.
Brand-agnostic throughout: every fact resolves through brands/<brand>/.
