"""The plumbing a stage runs on: find the prompt, fill it, send it, stamp it.

Four small things, kept together because every one of them is about the
PROMPT being the product (Damon's standing rule) rather than about calendars:

    latest_prompt(stage)   the highest -vN- file wins
    fill(template, fields) deterministic substitution, so a run replays
    claude(text, model)    one stateless call, text in, text out
    sha(path)              what exactly ran, stamped into the record

Moved out of the email chain's `email.py` on 2026-09-13 when the calendar
became its own component. Same bodies, same behaviour.
