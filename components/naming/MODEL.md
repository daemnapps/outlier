# The model — four axes, multiplied

Ruled 2026-09-11. Damon: *"angles should be able to be used for any channel and
format. So LETS GET REALLY CLEAR — channels, angles, formats all of that."*

Everything that gets made is one point in a four-axis space. The axes are
independent: fixing one never fixes another, and nothing may be a value on two
axes at once.

```
   AVATAR        ×      ANGLE       ×     CHANNEL      ×     FORMAT      =  an asset
   who it is           what we           where it            how it is
    for                 claim             runs                built

   4 core,            15 in the          4: paid-social,     25 banks, one
   each with          bank, only         organic-social,     per asset type
   sub-avatars        Damon signs        email, owned-pages
```

## Why this exact shape

It is not invented here. Two places in the repo had already worked it out, and
this file only writes down what they agree on:

> **`copy/bank/channel-map.json`** — *"Copywriting is one brain…
> A channel decides the reading context; a format is a data row inside it;
> **the words always come from the same place.**"*

> **`brands/<brand>/email/email-types.json`** — *"A TYPE is what the email IS…
> Types are multiplied by a FORM (how it is built), a TREATMENT (how it is
> played) and an AWARENESS level."*

Both say: separate axes, each a closed set, multiplied. Not one list.

## The test for each axis

| Axis | The question it answers | The test |
|---|---|---|
| **Avatar** | who is this for? | Is it a description of a person? |
| **Angle** | what are we claiming? | Can you say it as one sentence a customer could agree or disagree with? |
| **Channel** | where does it run? | Does it change the reader's *state* — interrupted, chosen, permitted, arrived? |
| **Format** | how is it built? | Is it camera, layout, beat order, text behaviour, slot? |

## The rules that follow

1. **An angle is channel-free and format-free.** The same claim runs as a Meta
   static, a TikTok video, an email and a landing page. If a thing only works
   in one container, it is a **format**, not an angle.
2. **An angle belongs to exactly one core avatar**, because a claim is aimed at
   a person — and may serve several **sub-avatars**, declared per asset, never
   as a second angle.
3. **A channel does not own words.** It sets the reading context and it owns
   surfaces (a headline is a paid-social surface). It never owns a claim.
4. **A format is scoped to one asset type.** The 50 organic-video structures
   are organic video only; they are not page formats or email templates. Every
   bank names its lane and says what it is NOT.
5. **Nothing is a value on two axes.** `slideshow-native` was an angle that was
   really a container. `Angle` is a row in the copy-surface bank, which is a
   claim filed as a format. Both are the same error in opposite directions.

## Still wrong, and known

**Eleven entries in the <brand> angle bank are formats** — `three-line-hook` is
a text template, `arrow-methods-grid` a slide layout, `product-as-method` a
placement rule. Seven of them are signed. Every one is a glow-up entry, which
is why the bank looks channel-coupled: those rows only work in one container,
which is the definition of a format.

They have not moved, and the reason is honest: **there is no bank for what they
are.** They are argument structures for static and slideshow creative. The
organic-video library is video only. The image-ad templates are render
templates — canvas, slots, typography — not argument structures. Opening a bank
for them is a naming decision, and naming decisions are Damon's.

**`lane` meant three different things and the addressing scheme used one of
them** — the asset lane (`organic-video`), the source lane (`paid | own |
organic`, `swipe-paid/corpus.py`), and the brand positioning lane (Brotherhood
/ 2.0). **Fixed 2026-09-11 by taking the ambiguous word out of the addressing
path**: the axis is `asset`, which the registry already called it and which
means exactly one thing. `corpus.py` keeps `lane` for the source axis, where it
is unambiguous, and the brand map keeps it for positioning. Three axes, three
contexts, and the one that names files no longer shares a word with the other
two.

The rule, now in the registry: *an address built on a word with three meanings
is the collision this registry exists to prevent.*
