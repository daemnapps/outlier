"""The out-dir jail — card CR-1's hard done-when, enforced structurally.

A run writes ONLY under `--out`. Not by convention and not by review: every
write this component performs goes through `OutDir`, which resolves the
candidate path and REFUSES anything that does not land under the out root,
naming the offending path. `runner/` contains no other write call site — that
is the property, and the declared test asserts it from the outside by
fingerprinting the tree AROUND the out dir and requiring it byte-unchanged
across a run, including a run that fails.

WHY THIS IS A DONE-WHEN AND NOT A PREFERENCE. A chain engine whose run root
sits inside the tree it runs from writes its outputs into the working copy,
and from that moment "the run" and "the repo" are one place: a run dirties
git, a git operation can eat a run, and anything wrapping the engine cannot
say what a run actually produced. That is the flaw this component exists to
cure, so the cure is a wall, not a habit.

WHAT COUNTS AS AN ESCAPE — every one refused, with the path named:

  - an ABSOLUTE path (`/tmp/x`), including one that happens to sit under the
    root. A caller that already knows the root does not need the jail, and
    accepting absolute paths would make every check below optional;
  - a PARENT TRAVERSAL that leaves the root (`../x`, `a/../../x`);
  - a path crossing an existing SYMLINK at any depth — the classic escape, and
    the one a pure-string check misses;
  - a path resolving to the out root ITSELF (that is a directory, not a file).

A root that is itself a symlink is fine: it is resolved once, up front, and
every candidate is compared against the resolved form.

Known and accepted limit: the symlink check is a check-then-write, so a
symlink planted between the check and the write would defeat it. Closing that
needs `O_NOFOLLOW` per component, which buys nothing against the failure this
card is about — a chain writing where it should not — and costs a portable
implementation. Stated here rather than discovered later.
