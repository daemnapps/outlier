"""`chain.json` — load, validate, resolve. The schema here IS the contract.

A chain lives at `components/chain-runner/chains/<chain>/chain.json` with its
prompt files beside it. This module turns that file into a `ChainSpec` or
refuses it — there is no third outcome and no repair-in-place, because a chain
that half-loads runs a shape nobody wrote.

FAILURE IS PART OF THE CONTRACT. A malformed chain.json raises `ChainSpecError`
carrying THE FILE and EVERY problem found, not just the first — a chain author
fixing one typo per run is a chain author who stops reading the errors. The
caller exits non-zero and writes NOTHING: validation completes before the out
directory is so much as created.

STRICT KEYS. An unknown top-level or stage key is an error, not something
ignored. `promt_version` silently doing nothing is how a chain quietly runs the
wrong prompt for a month.

BRAND-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION (workspace rule 7). Nothing in this module or
anywhere in `runner/` knows any brand, and there is no field where one could be
named: brand-shaped facts arrive as run-config variables, which are opaque
names to the engine, and a chain references them as `@config.<name>`.

#     @<earlier-stage>.<field>  one FIELD that stage declared it can extract
#     @<earlier-stage>#pick     its CONTROL VERSION — see engine.pick_control
#     @<earlier-stage>*         FAN-IN: every member's output of that stage
#     @config.<var>             a run-config variable
#
# The FIELD form arrived in CR-6 because a chain that routes on a fact a stage
# itself decides could previously only reference the whole opaque output. It
# reads as the dot already reads in `@config.<var>` — a name inside a named
# thing — and it splits on the FIRST dot, which is why neither a stage key nor
# a field name may contain one. Nothing here interprets a field's meaning: the
# engine knows a name and a parse rule, and no more than that.
#
# The two selectors arrived in CR-2b because the first imported chain uses both
# and a chain.json that could not spell them was importing a chain it could not
# run. They are spelled the way the source machine spells them ON PURPOSE: the
# import copies a reference across rather than translating one, so a reader
# diffing the two files sees the same token on both sides. Neither selector
# knows anything about that chain — `#pick` is a text rule over any stage's
# output, `*` is a fan-in over whatever members a run declares.
#
# `#pick` and `*` are mutually exclusive. A "control version of every member"
# has two readings (one pick per member, or a pick over the concatenation) and
# a reference with two readings is not a reference.

    Returns the declaration verbatim (so the record can state it in its

    exactly one field of one earlier stage. There is no `and`, no `or`, no
    `not`, and no expression string — the DAG kill line applies here first, and
    an expression language is how a data file quietly becomes a program.

    THE FIELD MUST BE DECLARED. `field` is a `@<earlier-stage>.<field>`
    reference and nothing else: not `@config.<var>` (a gate on a run-config
    value is a flag, not a chain deciding on its own output), not a whole stage
    output, and not a selector form. It is bound by the same ordering rule as
    an input, so a gate can only read what has already run, and by the same
    declaration rule, so a chain gated on a fact nobody arranged to extract is
    refused at compile rather than skipping half a run.

    COMPARISON IS EXACT STRING EQUALITY. An extracted value is text the
    extractor already stripped; nothing here lowercases, trims further or
    coerces. A gate that quietly matched `Organic` against `ORGANIC` would be
    an engine deciding what a chain's author meant.
