"""chain-runner — run a staged prompt chain. A RUN IS ONE COMMAND.

    python3 components/chain-runner/runner/run.py <chain> --out <dir>

`<chain>` is a key under `components/chain-runner/chains/`, so the command
above reads `chains/<chain>/chain.json` and its prompts, and writes everything
it produces under `--out` and nowhere else.

    --out DIR            where the run lands. REQUIRED, and the only place
                         this command writes. There is no default: a default
                         run root is how run output ends up inside a checkout.
    --chains-dir DIR     where chains live (default: the component's own
                         `chains/`). Fixture trees use this.
    --chain-file PATH    run a chain.json directly, instead of by key.
    --config FILE        run-config: a flat JSON object of variable names to
                         string values, referenced by a chain as
                         `@config.<name>`.
    --var NAME=VALUE     one run-config variable; repeatable; wins over
                         --config.
    --root NAME=PATH     one named content root, overriding a chain's declared
                         default of that name; repeatable. A root is an opaque
                         name here — what a root may POINT AT is checked (see
                         below), what it contains never is.
    --model-runner NAME  the model seam's implementation (default: stub —
                         the only one CR-1 registers).
    --check              validate the chain and report. Writes NOTHING, does
                         not create --out.
    --no-stamp           skip stamp.json, the run's only wall clock.
    --quiet              no progress on stderr; the exit code still speaks.

BRAND ENTERS ONLY HERE (workspace rule 7). Run-config variable names are
opaque to this engine: it substitutes them and records them, and there is no
field anywhere in `runner/` where a brand could be named. A brand-specific
chain is a chain, or a config file — never a branch in this code.

AND IT ENTERS FROM ONE PLACE (components/CLAUDE.md rule 9, "brand home"). A
declared root whose PATH SHAPE says it is a brand tree somewhere other than
`brands/<brand>/` is a FINDING, reported by `brandhome.py` before anything
runs: with --check it is printed and the command exits non-zero; without it the
run is refused, having written nothing. Detection is by path shape only and is
silent when the shape is ambiguous — prose review covers what a path cannot
say, and a false finding is worse here than a missed one.

CREDENTIALS ARE NOT RUN-CONFIG. Run-config is recorded verbatim in run.json,
so a secret passed as a `--var` would be written to disk in the clear. Vendor
keys reach a real model runner through the environment, scoped by the job's
grant row in `platform/workers/mini-worker/job_env.py`, and CR-1's stub reads
none of them.

EXIT CODES, because a caller needs to tell the failures apart:
    0  the run completed
    2  the chain spec is malformed (nothing was written, --out not created),
       INCLUDING a rule-9 finding against a root the CHAIN declares
    3  an OUT-DIR VIOLATION — a write was attempted outside --out
    4  the chain is valid but could not run on this config/invocation,
       INCLUDING a rule-9 finding against a root THIS INVOCATION declares
    1  anything unforeseen
