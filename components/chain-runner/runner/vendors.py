"""The REAL model runner — the only module in this component that touches a
vendor, and the only one that is never imported unless it is asked for.

    python3 runner/run.py <chain> --out <dir> --model-runner vendor

`models.py` registers this module LAZILY (`models.LAZY`): nothing imports it at
module load, so the component's structural promise survives intact — a run that
does not name `vendor` opens no socket and reads no credential, and the declared
test proves that by asserting this module is absent from `sys.modules` after the
whole suite has run. The guarantee moved from "there is no real runner" to "the
real runner is not loaded unless you say its name", which is the strongest form
the guarantee can take once a real runner exists at all.

WHAT IT BINDS, and why each is bound the way it is:

| model id | vendor | how |
|---|---|---|
| `gemini-*` (text/video) | Gemini | REST, `GEMINI_API_KEY` from the env |
| `gemini-*image*` | Gemini | the same REST call; image parts come back inline |
| `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `claude-*` | Claude | the `claude` CLI, on ITS OWN login |

Claude rides the CLI **exactly as the machine these chains were copied from
does** — `claude -p --model <id>` with the prompt on stdin — because that is
what parity means here, and because it needs no credential of ours: the CLI
holds its own login. There is no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in this job's grant row
(`platform/workers/mini-worker/job_env.py`, `chain-runner`:
`GEMINI_API_KEY, APIFY_TOKEN, FAL_KEY`) and this module never asks for one. A
credential the row does not carry is a STOP, not an improvisation.

CREDENTIALS ARE READ AT CALL TIME, never at import, and never out of run-config
(run-config lands in `run.json` in the clear). A missing key fails the stage by
name and says which grant row is supposed to supply it.

MEDIA IS PASSED THROUGH, NOT PROCESSED. A `MediaInput` is a location. A URI goes
to Gemini as `file_data`; a local file is handed to the Files API as the bytes
on disk and referenced by the uri it returns. Nothing is transcoded, resized,
sampled or frame-extracted — the moment this module opens a video to do
something clever with it, the engine has become a media tool and the component's
kill-condition has fired.

NO RETRY LADDER, NO MODEL FALLBACK. The source machine falls back to a second
Gemini when the first is busy and REPORTS which one answered. We do not: a
parity run whose stage silently bound a different model is measuring a different
chain, and `run.json` would still name the model the chain declared. A 503 is a
failed run the lead re-runs, which costs one operator minute and keeps the
manifest honest.
