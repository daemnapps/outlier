"""rule-9 (brand home) — a COMPILE FINDING, not a note somebody makes in review.

components/CLAUDE.md rule 9 (Dayu, 2026-09-01): an engine stays brand-agnostic
and takes brand CONTENT only from `brands/<brand>/` — the real brands tree, the
one home. This module is the mechanical half of that rule and the ONLY file in
`runner/` that knows the word: it reads the PATHS a run declares as roots and
says which of them take brand content from somewhere else. Nothing here
executes, resolves or substitutes anything, and `spec.py`'s data model and the
engine never call it — they stay brand-blind, which is the other half of the
ruling (PLAN rider (2), Dayu GO).

DETECTION IS BY PATH SHAPE, NEVER BY CONTENT. Classifying arbitrary files as
"brand content" is a judgement, and a judgement in a compile check is a check
people learn to override. So:

  PASSES   a root resolving under its own checkout's `brands/`.
  FINDING  a root resolving elsewhere whose path SAYS it is a brand tree —
           either (1) it walks through a `brands` directory that is not the
           home one (`lab/<person>/brands/<x>`, a copy at `scratch/brands/<x>`),
           or (2) one of its segments IS a brand that exists in the home (an
           ad-hoc copy at `lab/<person>/copy/<brand>/`).
  NOTHING  anything else — a path under no checkout at all, a path outside its
           checkout, a directory named nothing in particular.

The third case is the important one. FALSE POSITIVES ARE WORSE THAN MISSES
here: prose review still covers what a path cannot say, while a finding that
fires on legitimate roots gets routed around and takes the real findings with
it. When the shape is ambiguous this module is silent on purpose.

No brand name is written down anywhere in this file. The names in case (2) are
read out of the home tree at check time, because a brand name in this code is
the exact hard-coding workspace rule 7 forbids.

WHERE a checkout's home IS is no longer decided here (BH-1, 2026-09-02): the
LOCATOR — probe upward for `.git`, the home is `<checkout>/brands` — moved to
`components/brand-finder/`, which the two lab machines' `paths.py` now share.
It had three implementations converging by copy-paste. What stayed is this
file's whole job: deciding which declared roots take brand content from
somewhere OTHER than the home. Finding logic here, location there.
