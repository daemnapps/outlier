"""The gatherer's gates — where a pull is checked, and how a hold is recorded.

Rollout, 2026-09-20. The gatherer already refused bad work (a row with no
permalink is never written; a row from a room that plainly belongs to someone
else is never filed; no rooms means nothing is pulled). What it did not do is
SAY SO in the one place every tool says it. This module routes those holds
through the shared `components/quality-checks` `hold(gate, problems, out_dir)`,
so a pull that files nothing leaves a gate-keyed `check.json` in its run folder
and reads HELD — and it asks the one element library (`components/elements`)
whether the doctrine terms a research question names are real ones.

    inputs     before anything is pulled   the sub-avatar file exists; there are rooms to pull from
    elements   before anything is pulled   every technique / delivery dial a research question names is in the library
    delivery   before rows enter the bank  every row carries a permalink; no row from a mismatched room; something to file

WHAT PASSES AND FAILS IS UNCHANGED. `build_bank_rows` still does the dropping;
these functions only look at what it produced and write the verdict down.

Never raises (the engine's own rule): a missing quality-checks or elements
component is written down as "not checked", never a crash, and never a pass
that was not earned.
