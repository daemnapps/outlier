"""research-gatherer — the query-the-open-internet engine, as a component.

Two jobs (plan.md Part C / C2 of the Schwartz build):

1. **`inputs(st, chain_profile)`** — a Schwartz-shaped research packet for
   ONE run: forums pulled for the avatar's named rooms, comments on the
   swiped post, and (when the caller hands in a `chain_profile`) the
   language bank's own stage tags. Returns `{"research": <markdown>}` — the
   same shape `~var` callers already expect (the `creator_profile.py`
   precedent: `inputs(st)` returning a dict a chain binds by name). NEVER
   RAISES: a research gap is a section that says `[UNFILLED: why]`, never a
   stopped chain.

2. **`deep_for(...)` / `pick_thinnest(...)`** — the C2 deep-research
   trigger. Pulls for ONE sub-avatar using that file's OWN named rooms +
   desire words + the Schwartz research questions, and FILES verbatim rows
   — with permalinks — into that sub-avatar's own language bank. Brand- and
   chain-agnostic: it reads `brands/<brand>/core-avatars/**` and nothing
   else names a brand, avatar or room.

**Ships no stage map** (components rule, LL-1 precedent): which language
STAGE_USE keys a chain wants queried for its `language.md` section is a
per-chain definition. A caller hands it in as `chain_profile`:

    chain_profile = {
        "language_stages": ["depth", "spice"],       # STAGE_USE keys to query
        "language_for_stage": <a for_stage(...) callable>,   # that chain's own
        "run_dir": lambda st: Path(...) or None,      # where <run>/research/ goes
    }

Any key can be omitted — the section it feeds records `[UNFILLED: why]`
rather than guessing. `components/video-teardown/machine/research.py` and
any sibling chain's shim hand in their own map; this engine holds none.

Reuses rather than re-implements (workspace convention — CC-3):
  - `components/apify/reddit.py` — the Reddit door: its actor,
    its flags, its cap, its 403 handling. Driven through its own CLI
    contract (`main()` + `sys.argv`).
  - `swipe-organic/apify.py` — the shared Apify layer (token,
    spare-account fallback) and its per-platform comment actors.

Machine-agnostic (components rule 8): no credential read at import time,
`workspace` resolved via `configure()` or the default, every write under a
declared output folder. Every pull is capped (`research.json`) and prints
what it spent; forum pulls cache 14 days per (brand, avatar, sub, words,
rooms), comment pulls per source_url, so repeat runs on the same avatar
don't re-spend. No key / 403 / missing actor never raises.
