"""research-gatherer's declared test.

    python3 components/research-gatherer/test_research_gatherer.py

No pytest, no network, no dependency — same convention as
`components/marketing-doctrine/test_doctrine.py`. Every Apify-touching call
is monkeypatched; nothing here spends a cent or reaches the network. Proves
the things that would quietly rot: a missing key never raises, a row with no
permalink never gets written, a cache hit skips the pull, a dry run spends
nothing, pick-thinnest actually picks the thinnest, a room that plainly
belongs to a different set of people is dropped before a row is filed from it,
and the video-teardown shim still exposes a plain `inputs(st)` wired to this
engine (the LL-1 precedent: the shim is a re-export, not a second
implementation).
